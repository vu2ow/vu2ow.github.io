			EUDP WIFI AMPLIFIER<br />
			<br />
			Suitable for QO-100 operations. I was using this for SSB and digital 
			communications on QO-100 sucecssfully with HACKRF, ICOM-IC7100 + 
			Upconverter. Now selling it as I upgraded to Saro's PA module to 
			operate DATV also. My signals were always S9+5 on nets and hundreds 
			of QSOs. SMA input and N connector female for output to POTY 
			antenna. I have used this with 90 and 100 CM dishes with similar 
			results. <br />

			input through a common DC connector. This goes before the EUDP WIFI

			Helps to pre-amplify output from these SDRs to levels expected by 
			the EUDP amplifier. <br />

			GPSDO<br />
			<br />
			This is a homebrewed GPSDO in working condition. Built in a group 
			build exercise. Circuit was designed by VU2GHB, Hari based on GPSDO 
			by Yannic here -
			<a href="https://www.instructables.com/GPSDO-YT-Disciplined-Oscillator-10Mhz-Reference-Fr/">
			GPSDO YT, Disciplined Oscillator 10Mhz Reference Frequency. Low 
			Cost. Accurate. : 3 Steps - Instructables</a>. In addition to 
			providing 10Mhz accurate reference to several other devices, this 
			unit generates clean 25Mhz signal which can be fed to the LNB via 
			coaxial cable for stable receive of QO-100 SSB and digital signals. 
			Has 10 Mhz OCXO soldered to the board. I am selling this as I made 
			another one of my design. Just add a good GPS module to the white 
			connector and this is good to run straightaway. <br />

			SPECIAL ITEM - REXOLITE 10Ghz Lens<br />
			<br />
			Rexolite material is the best for dielectric lens. This can be 
			fitted on to POTY antenna to receive 10Ghz downlink from QO-100. 
			This design is based on HB9PZK with minor mods from me. This will 
			give much better performance, especially on DATV and also in narrow 
			band QO-100 receive, than 3D printed lens we are using currently. 
			Fits into Saro's poty antenna - can be sealed with teflon tape and / 
			or silicone sealant. Pieces were milled in CNC and each piece has 
			been personally handpolished by me. <br />

			Roller Inductor<br />

			to tune a random length sky loop antenna I had on my terrace. These 
			were once in my "balanced-balanced tuner". I have had many 
			delightful DXing with these. <br />

			bring this to a super shining condition. <br />

			VUSDR<br />
			<br />
			Working VUSDR piece 1-28Mhz SDR transceiver. This was built in a 
			group build in Chennai few years back. Conducted by ZAZ Naidu and 
			Sasi. Works well with HDSDR. I have used this sparingly. With 5 
			watts from it, I have checked in to nets and have had long distance 
			QSOs. In current state, the receive works perfectly but Transmit 
			side needs some work - it may require replacement of IRF510 and the 
			biasing pot or both. As such this may be very good to be used as an 
			exiter for QO-100 at 28 Mhz and an upconverter like Saro's to get 
			transmission at 2400 Ghz. Buy this if you are somewhat of a 
			homebrewer. <br />
