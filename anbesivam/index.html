<p class="MsoNormal">I had agreed to write about a discussion in our group on “<span style="font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
&quot;Nirmala UI&quot;,sans-serif">அன்பே சிவம்</span><span style="font-family:&quot;Nirmala UI&quot;,sans-serif">” 
or “Love is God” and few people emphatically agreed that these two are very 
meaningful and is the ultimate meaning of life. I wanted to write very 
elaborately on this topic but would like to keep it crisp this time and I am 
sure there will be opportunities to cover other points. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family:&quot;Nirmala UI&quot;,sans-serif">There was also 
another topic in our group regarding evolution – a contention that scientists 
and those of us who are very educated in the western style would subscribe to 
too. Evolutionists say that complex organisms evolved from simpler ones. I had 
told earlier that this is improbable even in the case of a single celled 
organism. For example, a bacterium to evolve into a bacterium with flagellum (a 
spiral hair which helps the bacteria move), the probability is incomprehensibly 
low when calculated mathematically. A flagellum is driven by a cellular motor 
(you can search it in the web) which spins like a real life motor. Could such an 
incredible machine be evolving by itself? It makes sense to believe that a more 
intelligent being creates lesser capable and evolved beings doesn’t it? This 
exactly is what is taught by our philosophy. It is not hard to imagine that that 
a spirit soul or Jiva “evolves” over successive births as it passes through more 
evolved bodies. Once it enters the body of a human, it gets profoundly powerful 
mind, buddhi and chittha to really analyze, hear and understand the purpose of 
life, which is to get rid of the birth cycles. A child evolves into a man. A 
student evolves into a great musician…… Meaning of evolution should be this 
rather than evolution of “bodily structures”. Pinnacle of evolution is to reach 
a stage where a body is no longer a requirement as bodies are degradable, 
destructible and painful – yantra rudani mayaya. Body is just a machine made of 
“energy” which gets dismantled and dispersed after its time. <o:p></o:p></span>

<span style="font-family:&quot;Nirmala UI&quot;,sans-serif">Those who say that 
everything happened by itself – they say that in primordial times, there was a 
soup of chemicals on the surface of the earth, somehow they combined to form a 
single celled organism and then bigger organisms came from it by evolution – 
these people go on and come up with weird and wildly speculative theories on how 
the universe came about – big bang – and all that and dumb ones listen to them. <o:p></o:p>

</span></span></span><![endif]>
<span style="font-family:&quot;Nirmala UI&quot;,sans-serif">Those, after several 
births contemplating the above theories, agree that … OK…. these theories are 
questionable – there is a “thing” called nature which creates all these. It is 
indeed mysterious and powerful, but no, it cannot have a personality. To think 
that it has a personality is dumb and immature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span style="font-family:&quot;Nirmala UI&quot;,sans-serif">Yes… I felt I should 
add this too – an afterthought, hours after publishing the original. The 2.5 
folks are 2 but would believe miracles exist and would like to see them once in 
a while to bolster their belief. These folks mainly throng the miracle men who 
exhibit supernatural powers. If they are gone, the 2.5s visit temples 
constructed for them, praying for miracles and heal them. The godmen they pray 
when they are alive or dead, are always frustrated that people throng just to 
see the miracles. Not to actually learn to inquire, listen, practice and 
benefit. I quote Richard Bach here…. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">
<span style="font-family:&quot;Nirmala UI&quot;,sans-serif"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
<span style="font-family:&quot;Nirmala UI&quot;,sans-serif">and it came to pass 
when he (the messiah guru) saw that the multitude thronged him the more day on 
day, tighter and closer and fiercer than ever they had, when he saw that they 
pressed him to heal them without rest and feed them always his miracles, to 
learn for them and to live their lives, he went alone that day unto a hilltop 
apart, and there he prayed……<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<span style="font-family:&quot;Nirmala UI&quot;,sans-serif">There are those who 
have come to a conclusion that if nature is so powerful that it can create a 
motor at cellular level, it can as well take a personality – in any form – human 
or animal. And to those who have reached further evolution within this stage 3, 
this uttering from Lord Krishna will make sense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span style="font-family:&quot;Nirmala UI&quot;,sans-serif">The Lord says that 
of all the yoni’s (has two meanings – relevant one here is “of all species”), in 
this creation, I AM THE SEED GIVING FATHER. Here seed means the basic building 
block of a species (840,000,000 species in all). He has enabled his deputies to 
create organisms based on the seeds provided by him. It is not that organisms 
evolved by themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">
<span style="font-family:&quot;Nirmala UI&quot;,sans-serif">So…. Having said 
that evolution is a process for a jiva soul to arise through a successful 
platforms of physical bodies to get into a human form, within which they evolve 
mentally and spiritually to get released from the material bonding, let us see 
how. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">
<span style="font-family:&quot;Nirmala UI&quot;,sans-serif"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">
<span style="font-family:&quot;Nirmala UI&quot;,sans-serif">Human body is built 
specifically to receive, assimilate and transmit life energies. Discussion on 
what these energies are is a separate topic by itself. Human body has a visible 
physical gross body and subtle spiritual body which becomes visible only when 
one develop clairvoyant powers. It is in the subtle body that the most 
remarkable things happen. This becomes accessible to those who practice yogic 
techniques and by being strict in diet and habits. The energies enter, leave, 
circulate and transmit through nodal centers in the subtle body. These nodal 
centers’ development is completely based on a person’s mental evolution. The 
lowest nodal center is responsible for the basic survival aspect of the human 
organism – in a child, this is probably the only nodal point which is developed. 
A child’s only motivation is to eat and survive. Mental faculties are not 
developed at this stage. If this is the case in an adult human, the person will 
be severely depressed, suicidal and having no motivation to meet people, even 
eat and survive. Next higher nodal center is associated with emotions and 
desires of procreation. Love at this stage is purely lust and animalistic – we 
haven’t reached the title of this essay yet. Next higher nodal center is 
associated with power, will to do things – achieve, self-esteem, ego etc…Person 
with this evolvement level will try to establish a career, income, sustenance, 
power etc. Even at this stage, the person is like the neighbors in Indian 
apartments – fight for parking, water, amenities and analysis of whose children 
is most adorable and so on. Most people end their life at this stage. Next 
higher nodal point is where we come to our topic – anbe sivam. This point is 
associated with real love, acceptance. To a person who has crossed over this, a 
whole new paradigm opens up. This nodal point is perhaps the toughest to cross – 
the க்ரந்தி (knot) is so tight that it is not easy to open it up here in this 
nodal point. By being close and in loving nature with himself, other humans and 
even other life forms, the person feels close to God. This is how அன்பே சிவம் 
came about. There are further steps to evolution though – the next higher nodal 
point – communication, creativity, invention, so on and so forth. At this level 
of evolution, the person will be able to convince, deliver speech, direct other 
people and create better world and products. Next higher level nodal point is 
associated with imagination, mental power, clairvoyance, intelligence, 
intuition, occult and so on. At this level of evolution, the man begins to think 
all the developments in previous stage are fine but there is something lacking. 
He starts searching for the ultimate happiness and the source of this universe, 
“which” is also the source of happiness. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The 
final Nodal point to open gives the person complete knowledge as the Jiva itself 
is made of knowledge (ஞானஸ்வரூபீ).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
Person can receive cosmic instructions, establish supernatural contacts, 
transcend consciousness and enter a state a fullness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
