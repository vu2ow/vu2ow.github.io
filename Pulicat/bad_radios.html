			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left">A microwave oven cooks 
			the food by passing high power (about 750 - 1000) watts of small 
			wavelength, high frequency (2000 Mega Hertz MHz) radio waves. This 
			radiation happens inside a shielded chamber so that it doesn’t come 
			out. There are folks who tried to beat the mechanism (door open 
			warning) and have gone blind by peering into the cooking chamber. 
			Facts and studies on damage caused to the food by such radiation are 
			like several cans of worms. Radiation from cell phones and cell 
			phone towers heat up body tissue. Also, there is a claim that this 
			radiation caused DNA damage and cause cancer. Higher the frequency, 
			shorter is the wavelength and higher is the absorption rate in the 
			body! So, all radio waves are harmful but higher frequencies are 
			deadly. In olden days, they used to treat body aches with high power 
			radio waves directed on the body. They used longer wavelengths…works 
			by heating up the affected area… but this treatment has been quietly 
			banned now! There is a case where a person accidentally walked 
			across a big C band (5000 MHz) dish antenna on roof top transmitting 
			TV program to satellite and died few days later because of exposure.
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left">We are relentlessly 
			bombarded by many type of electromagnetic radiations in our life. 
			FCC of US regulates that any appliance should not emit harmful 
			radiation which will interfere with other devices. But with our 
			muniyandi brand mixies and other devices, who is enforcing these 
			regulations? </p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left">Located near a 
			residential area near Avadi, our All India Radio station, Chennai, 
			transmits 20,000 (20 KW) watts of power in medium wave (783 Khz). 
			Remember, a microwave cooks your food at 1000 watts
			<span style="font-family: Wingdings;">J</span> People are unaware. 
			Following is the list of government run stations… Think how many 
			other FM stations (private) are operating in Chennai alone! DOT 
			generates lot of revenue by allocating “spectrum” to these 
			commercial stations / cell phone companies. </p>

			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left">Thank god medium, 
			short and long waves pass through the body and hence heating effect 
			is minimal… however, I think stress levels of people living near 
			these transmitters will be high. Also, the distance from the antenna 
			matters…. Exposure reduces exponentially when you move away from the 
			antenna.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left">Ham radio operators, 
			who are crazy about their hobby are constantly worried about 
			interference in their spectrum. Those days are gone when the “band 
			was quiet” so that one could hear transmission from a fellow ham 
			operating thousands of miles of away easily.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left">Ham radio operators 
			report signals from other stations with RST system.</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left">R -&nbsp; Readability 
			- Understanding what is said and how well. On a scale of 1 to 5, the 
			readability of your signal with a "5" being perfect with no 
			difficulty. In other words the ability of the other operator to 
			understand what you are saying. A "1" is unreadable....a "5" is 
			perfectly readable.<br />
			<br />
			S -&nbsp; Strength - On a scale of 1 to 9, indicates how strong your 
			stations signal is. A "1" is a very faint signal. A"9" is an 
			extremely strong signal. </p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left"><br />
			T - Used for morse code signal reports. Indicates on a scale of 1 to 
			9 the quality of the tone of the morse code "dits and dahs".&nbsp; 
			From a "60 cycle harsh tone" a (1).... To a "very pure tone", a (9).</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left">A good sounding phone 
			(voice) signal from a fellow ham reported as 59 means readability is 
			perfect (5) and strength is extremely strong (9). These days, due to 
			the noise from “radio pollution “, my radio in Chennai reads 59 
			without any transmission at all! It means that it is receiving noise 
			at that signal level! It is very difficult for me to work with other 
			stations with signal strength less than 57! The other station has to 
			break the noise floor! Only solace is that with improvements in 
			digital signal processing and growth in chip technology it is 
			possible to filter out signal from noise better. However, an average 
			enthusiastic “home brewer” is finding it more and more difficult to 
			source components (companies would not distribute parts… and even if 
			they do, special labs are needed to solder them without damage) and 
			build radios. </p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left">Ham folks take pride 
			in designing their own antennas and build their own radios to talk 
			to each other from great distances with minimal power (sometimes as 
			low as 1 Watt to 100 watts) and less bandwidth. There is a breed of 
			hams that will not transmit more than 5 watts – these are called QRP 
			enthusiasts! The bands have become so noisy these days in the cities 
			with radio pollution from appliances, automobiles, you name them. 
			Often ham radio folks move away from the city for a day or two, on 
			“field days”… take their radios on boats, mountain tops and have 
			field day. </p>
