			At present it appears to be calm over entire Tamil Nadu, sunny in 
			most places. There is still possiblity of rain as observed in this

			is the process in which heated air moves up over a region to create 
			low pressure and wet air rushing from sea to fill up the gap and 
			then pour. This is very active in Chennai region.
