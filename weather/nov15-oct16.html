			As agni nakshathram is blazing, we have rain clouds over Tamil Nadu 
			and Southern Kerala, India. Usually clouds forms in the first week 
			of June as South West Monsoon sets in. This year, we saw rising 
			temperatures we usually see in May, during end of March and April itself. 
			This has resulted in this unusual formation. According to legends, 
			if this happens during Agni Nakshatra time, when Sun is in Mesha, 
			and if rains too much, Monsoon is bound to fail. But nature has some 
			times negated legends and more so modern scientific predictions. 
			Prediction - Heavy rain expected in Southern Districts of Tamil Nadu 
			like Madurai and also Eastern coast line. Some parts of Kerala and 
			Vishakapattinam to receive moderate to heavy rain.&nbsp; <br />
