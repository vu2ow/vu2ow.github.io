			<span class="auto-style4"><span class="auto-style5">It was decided 
			to replace the cable and clean up the X510 antenna. <strong>Note : 
			X510 was given by VU2SBU in used condition and the old cable was 
			given by VU2BBF Arun Kumar.</strong> The X510 had cracks in the 
			bottom part even while installing the antenna a while back and it 
			gradually widened - to a dangerous level on 23rd. <br />
			<br />
			We attempted to bring the part to Aluminum welder but learnt that 
			the material is a die cast - actually an alloy and not pure aluminum 
			and hence welding did not work. The part broke apart.&nbsp; </span>

			cleaned up the part by chipping off the corroded metal, as much as 
			possible, without damaging the fibre glass tube inside. The metal 
			part is glued very well to the fibreglass and the radial holder

			will result in permanent damage to the antenna. </span></td>

			picture and snugly fits into the slot below the radial holder part. 
			We decided to cut a portion of this and weld an additional piece at 
			the bottom (to replace the broken area indicated in the first 
			picture). This part is crucial as it holds the inner radiating 
			element with SO239 connector.</span>&nbsp;</td>
